# CSVParsers
A collection of safely-typed simple CSV file parsers in Java, Kotlin, C#, and C++, designed as simply and idiomatically as possible.
Most of the implementations use a combination of Reflection and Annotations / Attributes, except for C++ which uses template metaprogramming and variadic type templates.
